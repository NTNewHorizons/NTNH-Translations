Aiming a mirror at the boiler can be done using the mirror adjustment tool, right-click on the boiler will save its position to the tool, and subsequently clicking on mirrors will aim them at the linked boiler. The maximum range for mirrors is 25 blocks, mirror efficiency does not degrade with range. A boiler consumes 1mB of water for every 12.5 mirrors each tick at full sunlight level, and 100mB of steam per mB of water consumed. However, the water consumption rate is rounded down to the millibucket. Thus it takes 13 mirrors to raise your first 100mB/t of steam, 12 mirrors for the next hundred, then 13, 12, and so on.%n%nAs the heat provided by each mirror is based on sunlight, mirrors with solid blocks above them will not work, and the amount of heat diminishes with the amount of light in the evening until it produces no heat at night.%n%nThe solar tower boiler can only produce regular steam, and thus the liquid type cannot be changed using fluid identifiers.

The gravity here slightly exceeds that of Earth, and on Eve, there are local volcanoes. What are they? They are energy geysers in the form of standalone basalt mountains up to 30 meters high with a channel in the center where the core is located, which can be mined and taken with you. Every 15 seconds, this structure emits a glowing column of energy upward, illuminating the entire sky around as if after a lightning flash. The beam is dangerous to all living things\: it deals 20 HP damage.%n%nThe local atmosphere is extremely aggressive and contains potassium permanganate (30%%), mercury (25%%), ammonia (15%%), and xenon (5%%). The air can literally dissolve many types of armor, after which it starts damaging the player themselves (a warning 'My suit is melting' appears on the screen). As you understand, the local atmosphere is unsuitable for breathing.%n%n[warn]Underground, there are deposits of almost all known useful metals and other ores. The lakes are full of mercury.

betterquesting.quest.vTg3C5JATXuER43bG5IiiQ.desc=The formation of a volcano is driven by the volcanic core, a block that continuously erupts lava, allowing the volcano to grow. The lava cools quickly, turning into basalt or basaltic ore.%n%nThe resulting volcano grows quite slowly, reaching about 60 blocks in height over 20-30 minutes.%nVolcanic lava differs from regular lava not only in appearance. It "melts" any non-explosion-resistant blocks, so the volcano can extend underground.%nBasaltic ores (asbestos, sulfur, fluorite, molysite) form when the lava cools, each with a 0.5%% chance.%n%nVolcanic gem ore spawns with a 5%% chance if the following conditions are met\:%n- All 6 blocks around the cooling lava are basalt or lava;%n- The block 10 blocks above the cooling lava is basalt or lava;%n- There are fewer than 3 lava blocks around the cooling lava.%nThe ore also forms after volcanic lava contacts diamond ore.%nThis means volcanic gems most often appear near the core or crater of the volcano.%n%n[note]Forming a Radioactive Volcano%nIf the volcanic core is exposed to radioactive fallout (e.g., after a nearby nuclear explosion) for some time, the core will begin generating new volcanic radioactive lava (yellow in color), ultimately leading to the formation of a so-called radioactive volcano. Such a volcano will consist not of basalt but of various types of quenched sellaphite blocks and sellaphite ores. The lava will convert diamond ores into radioactive gem ore.[/note]

betterquesting.quest.5PE7heWhR4qG8AcOcZ0VWQ.name=Spatial IO
betterquesting.quest.5PE7heWhR4qG8AcOcZ0VWQ.desc=§3Spatial IO§r is a way to cut-and-paste physical volumes of space in your world. It works by swapping the defined volume with an identically-sized volume in the spatial storage dimension, sending whatever's in the pylon array to the spatial storage dimension, and whatever's in the dimension to the pylon array.%n%nSpatial IO requires a specific arrangement of its components in order to function, and define the volume to be cut-and-pasted. All of the components must be on the same network in order to function, and you can have only one spatial IO setup on a network. Thus, a subnetwork is recommended.%n%nThe §3Spatial IO Port§r controls the spatial IO operation. It shows stats on the multiblock setup, and holds the spatial cells%n%nTo perform a spatial IO operation, place a §6Spatial Storage Cell§r in the input slot and give the spatial IO port a redstone pulse. It will then swap the volume in the pylons with the volume in the spatial storage dimension. This means that if you send some set of blocks to the spatial storage dimension, then put another set of blocks in the pylons, put the cell back in the input slot, and trigger the IO port again, the 2nd set of blocks will disappear and the 1st set of blcks will reappear.%n%nAny entity in the defined volume, including you, will be carried along, and if you have no way of getting out, you will be trapped in the spatial storage dimension.%n%n§3Spatial Pylons§r are the main part of a spatial IO setup, and define the volume to be affected. The volume is defined by the bounding box of the outside of the pylons, contracted in by 1 block in all directions.

This means you can output to as many points as you want, but only input at a single point per tunnel.%n%nNetworks can support any number of tunnels, of any different types, and they all function independently.%n%nME tunnels can be used to carry channels from one location to another, and can carry up to §e32 channels§r, same as a §6ME Dense Cable§r, while only requiring a single channel per point, making tunnels a very powerful tool to expand me networks, especially over a distance. However with the great flex-ability they give you comes a limitation, the channel of a p2p tunnel cannot be carried by another p2p tunnel, meaning that you cannot nest them recursively.%n%nTo configure a P2P tunnel you must first attune the tunnel to carry what you want it to, then you need to configure the outputs to their input. You configure the connections by using the §6Memory Card§r. First Shift+Right Click the input to save it on your memory card, then simply right click the different outputs to store the input onto the outputs. this also sets the type of the output to match the type of the input.%n%n§2An advanced version of the Memory Card can also be made, which interacts with the entire network.
